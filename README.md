# Fraud Detection System

## Introduction
The Fraud Detection System is a machine learning-based solution designed to identify fraudulent transactions in financial data. This system leverages various machine learning algorithms and techniques to build a robust fraud detection model capable of accurately identifying fraudulent activities while minimizing false positives.

## Features:

### Data Preprocessing: 
The system preprocesses the raw transaction data, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing class imbalance issues.
### Feature Engineering: 
Relevant features such as transaction amounts, timestamps, account balances, and transaction types are extracted to improve model performance.
### Model Selection: 
Various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression are evaluated to determine the most suitable model for fraud detection.
### Evaluation Metrics: 
The system assesses model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).
### Visualization: 
Visual representations such as ROC curves, precision-recall curves, and histograms of predicted probabilities are generated to analyze model behavior and performance.
